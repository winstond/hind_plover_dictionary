#SpecialCases

|rdh|ढ़|-RD/H|When splitting syllables, end last syllable -RD and begin next syllable on H|
|-ng|अंग|-\*PBG/KP|When splitting syllables, this usually sounds like ng on the end of the first syllable and g on the beginning of the next|
|-ngh|अंघ|-\*PBG/KPH|When splitting syllables, this usually sounds like ng on the end of the first syllable and gh on the beginning of the next|
|jh|झ|-PBLG or -PBLG/H|When splitting syllables and no matra, allow for both SKWHR and SKWHR/H|
|ddh|द्ध|-D/TKH or -D/H + matra if necessary|Works middle or end of word.  Suggest making strokes for both.|
|चह,पह,etc|ह|AEU|ह after a regular consonant like प,च, etc., and with NO vowel matra and not end of word, often has a blended sound.  Represent with consonant-stroke+AEU.  Note: If the ह starts the syllable this rule may not apply.|
