# Theory Documentation
Reference documentation for पत्थर सिद्धांत (stone theory), a hindi/devanagari machine steno theory.

## About Hindi

Hindi is written in a script called [Devanagari](https://hindilanguage.info/devanagari/).  Devanagari consists of consonants and stand-alone vowels.  However, when written vowels most commonly appear in words as a maatra sign.  Therefore, when writing hindi each consonant has a form of the consonant+matra representing the consonant with the vowel sound.

Hindi Devanagari is considered a mostly phonetic script, meaning the written word accurately reflects the pronunciation.  Therefore, if you learn the Devanagari script then sounding out words in Hindi is much easier than for example English where the same grouping of letters may have different sounds when spoken (ex. pour, hour).

For the remainder of this document, it is assumed that the reader knows Hindi and can read Devanagari.

### Keyboard Layout

There are many types of machine shorthand in the world.  This theory leverages the English machine shorthand system known as [Stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype), and also known as the [Ward Stone Ireland layout](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Ward_Stone_Ireland_layout).

For the balance of this documentation, it is assumed that you are familiar with Stenotype and the standard Ireland layout.

### Machine Stenography and CAT software

To use this or any machine steno theory to write on your computer you require a steno machine with the Ireland layout (there are many including enthusiast machines designed as keyboards), and CAT (Computer Aided Translation) software.  

For the CAT software, there are a number of professional (and very expensive!) options.  However, this author uses [Plover](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Beginner%27s_Guide) which is an open-source CAT created by the [Open Steno Project](https://www.openstenoproject.org/) which is completely free to use and works on Windows/MAC/Linux.

For the steno machine, there are professional machines used by court reporters (which tend to be quite expensive).  However, there are also hobbyist keyboards designed with the Ireland layout that are inexpensive and easy to use.  You can see some listed on the [Commercially available hobbyist writers](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Supported_hardware#Commercially_available_hobbyist_writers) on the Plover website.

Please note: This author uses only Plover CAT software.  Plover uses JSON format to define the dictionary.  Most professional CAT software uses a different text file format for their dictionaries.  It should not be terribly difficult to convert the dictionaries found here to another format.  However, that is outside the scope of this documentation and this project.

For the balance of this document, it will be assumed that you have a steno machine with the Ireland layout, have a CAT installed, and know how load a steno dictionary.

### Consonant Sounds and Spelling

### Left Hand Side

Left hand side means here the consonant sound when beginning a word or syllable and therefore stroked using the left hand steno keys.

#### Base Consonants

Left Hand Side for the base consonant sounds (i.e. the consonants in the alphabet only)

#### Additional Consonant Sounds/Spellings

Left Hand Side for additionaly consonant sounds (i.e. consonant sounds beyond the alphabet only such as combined sounds)

### Right Hand Side

Right hand side means here the consonant sound when ending a word or syllable and therefore stroked using the right hand steno keys.

#### Base Consonants

Right Hand Side for the base consonant sounds (i.e. the consonants in the alphabet only)

#### Additional Consonant Sounds/Spellings

Right Hand Side for additionaly consonant sounds (i.e. consonant sounds beyond the alphabet only such as combined sounds)

### Vowel Sounds and Spelling

#### Vowel Omission

A quick note on the default _a_ sound in Hindi.  We will follow the convention of ommiting the vowel in these strokes.  So, for example a syllable that consists of consonant-defaul_a_sound-consonant will be stroked using just the left hand side and right hand side consonant.  However, when the default _a_ vowel sound begins or ends a syllable/word, it will be included in the stroke.

#### Base

Base here means the most common way of stroking the base vowel sounds when they appear in a word/syllable.

#### Additional

Additional here means vowel sounds (such as diphthongs) beyond the base vowel sounds when then appear in a word/syllable.

#### Special

Special here refers to rules for vowel sounds when they appear in specific places in a word.  This is typically done to avoid conflicts or issues with word boundaries.

### Consonant-Vowel Word Parts and Blends

These rules cover special cases where a specific stroke is used on the left or right hand side with a specific combination consonants and vowels.  These rules may exist to avoid conflicts and word boundary issues, or to shorten the number of strokes needed to produce words with these combinations.

### Prefixes and Suffixes

Specific and common prefix and suffix strokes for highly used prefixes and suffixes in the Hindi language.

### Mandatories and Briefs

A brief is using a single stroke to write either an entire multi-syllable word or multiple syllables of a larger word.  These will be used for high volume words to reduce the number of strokes.  Where possible, this will follow patterns to make these briefs easier to remember.

A mandatory is simply a brief to write a word where that brief is the *only* way to write the word.  This is typically done to avoid conflicts where that sound is used in other words.

Note: A brief can also be created for a whole phrase (multiple words).  This is less common, but can be very helpful for high volume phrases.

### Finger-spelling

When spelling out a proper name, or to write a word that isn't in the dictionay yet, fingerspelling may be used.  In general, fingerspelling is done by adding \*R to the left hand side basic consonant stroke.  However, you may have noticed that some left hand side consonant strokes are used for multiple characters that have similar or identical pronunciations (ex. श and ष both use "SH" for the left hand side).  With that in mind, there will be a separate stroke for the second character (so in fingerspelling we'll use  SH\*R for श and SKHR\*R for ष).  In the below list, items with an > notation in front items where fingerspelling a consonant will use a different left hand side pattern that it usually would in a word.

### Months, Days, States and Cities

Briefs specifically for months, days, states and well know cities will be here.

### Punctuation

Punctuation is mostly similar to English.  However, Hindi uses the । character for end of sentence.  Also, for greater readability a space is added before punctuation such as ?, !, etc. when used for end of sentence.  I have used strokes common for English Phoenix Theory as that is what I use for English.  Feel free to substitute your own preferences.  Punctuation is kept in a separate dictionary file for convenience.

### Numbers and Ordinals

Number and Ordinal strokes here.  This will include sections with shortcuts for writing lakhs, crore, etc. (commas in the correct places) as well as strokes to add rupee symbol and so forth.  Number strokes will include options to output hindi numerals or arabic numerals.

### Dates and Times

Methods for writing dates and times efficiently.

### Special cases

Can include phone numbers or other alpha-numeric items that are heavily used and follow a specific pattern (Aaadhar number for example).
