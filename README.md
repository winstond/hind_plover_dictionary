Welcome to the first ever (as far as I'm aware) machine stenography theory for outputing Hindi Devanagari!

## Why a hindi machine steno theory?

As a Hindi learner learning the hindi language and the Devanagari script, I found that the existing methods for inputing Devanagari on the computer were cumbersome and slow.  Since I have familiarity with English Stenography (which allows for much faster production of English text) I thought, why not create a theory for Hindi.  So, here we are.

## Welcome to पत्थर सिद्धांत (stone theory)

Well, every English Steno theory has a name (Stened, Phoenix, Realtime/Realwrite, Roberts/Walsh/Gonzales, Magnum, Plover).  So, my new Hindi theory has a name too!  I'm calling it पत्थर सिद्धांत (stone theory) in the hopes that it will be solid as a rock for writing Hindi Devanagari.

## The Latest!
As of now, we have a words dictionary (~4,000 words), a fingerspelling dictionary (feature complete), and theory documentation (significant documentation completed, but still quite a bit to be added).

I would say we are now rapidly approaching what I would consider a full theory, with fully realized theory rules/documentation, and the ability to write a reasonable vocabulary efficiently.  But, we're not quite there yet...

## Usage

Oh, you want to try it now?  Ok.  I'll add more "getting started" documentation soon, but this is the minimum you'll need to do.  Note that the dictionaries are designed for the [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/) Steno CAT software.  Plover is the only free/open source Steno CAT out there, and it is the only one I use.  These instructions assume you already have Plover installed, know how to use it, and have some reasonable experience with machine stenography (likely from using stenography for English).  

1. Download the hindi_words.json and hindi_fingerspelling.json dictionary files to your computer (store it wherever you like to keep your Plover dictionaries)
2. In Plover, add the dictionary.  It does not require any add-ins at this time.
3. When enabled, you can now output hindi characters using Plover.  You will be able to write words found in the "hindi_words.json" dictionary and/or write words by using the fingerspelling strokes found in "hindi_fingerspelling.json" dictionary.
4. Consult the current (theory documentation)[https://github.com/winstond/hind_plover_dictionary/blob/main/Documentation/TheoryDocumentation.md] for details.

## Want to talk to me about it?

Of course you do.  You can find me on the [Plover Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Gr7rHZAHa5).  After joining the Plover Discord Channel, find the Hindi Stenography discussion in the #hindi-हिनदी channel on the server.  Hope to meet you there!

## History and Milestones

- July 2023: Idea for a Hindi Steno theory proposed in the Plover Discord and a Plover Discord channel, #hindi-हिनदी, created for discussion.
- September 2023: A "Fingerspelling Only" dictionary published which allowed the user to write any word in Devanagari, but without word boundaries (i.e. you would have to stroke a space to end your word.)  Fingerspelling documentation publised on the README page.
- December 2024: First hindi word dictionary published.  First in-progress theory documentation published.  Fingerspelling dictionary overhauled.

## Future Timeline (anticipated)

- Reach the 5,000 word milestone and finish/publish complete theory documentation by end of January, 2025.
- Reach the 10,000 word milestone by end of 2025.
